## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Ostium is a private Splitgate server, this allows our users to play against bots or against their friends while the servers are down or right after an update! Using Ostium you don't gain any levels or progress on the Splitgate servers as we're using our server software which is completely detached from the Splitgate servers.

Doing this it allows us to implement other features such as a modding framework and cosmetic support, we also wish to support custom asset streaming which would allow users to create their own weapon and character skins and view/use them with Ostium.
