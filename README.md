## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Ostium is a offline version of Splitgate that allows users to play an offline version of Splitgate while the servers are offline or you're stuck in queue! This allows you to play against bots, you can modify match settings etc as well. Although you're able to play Splitgate you won't be gaining any XP or levels from this as you're not logging into the Splitgate servers. We also include a way of doing online private matches against your friends when the servers are down, our launcher and framework far exceed that of any others as we wish to provide you with the best modded experience possible!
